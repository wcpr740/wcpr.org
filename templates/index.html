            Not just known for our 24/7 original, independent programming, we're a welcoming community of music geeks that book shows with artists we love, offer lights and sound for events on campus, curate a one-of-a-kind record library, and provide students with valuable experience â€“ including broadcasting, marketing, recording, business management, and arts advocacy!
            <br><br>
            Does what we do sound good to you? Then come on by our open meetings every other Wednesday at 9:30 PM on the third floor of Alexander House.
